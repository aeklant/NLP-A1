Discussion:
****************************************
The results for classification accuracy range from 65.46% to 72.42%, which is 
significantly higher than the results we got from the weka classifiers. 
Furthermore, we can see that there is a significant increase between the 500 
dataset and the 2500 dataset and only a slight increase between the 2500 and 
the 5000 dataset which suggests an exponential increase in accuracy wrt the 
dataset size, although with only three samples, we cannot tell for sure. 

Another interesting observation is that even though the results are better 
than those of weka, we were expecting an accuracy greater than 80%. We thought 
this could be due to either a preprocessing error, biased (or insuficient) 
training data. Given the fact that we ran the tests a few times to account for 
preprocessing error (i.e. we fixed possible errors in the preprocessing between 
test runs) and the results were identical so we hypothesize that the results 
are due to bias in the dataset.

We could also conclude that considering the semming increase in accuracy as the 
training data grows larger and the apparent issue with the biased dataset, the 
watson natural language processor uses deep learning techniques to achieve its 
results. This is of course, conjecture and would need more thorough testing to 
be confirmed. 

One more thing to note is that there is a clear difference of approximately 5% 
in confidence when the classifier makes a correct prediction compared to when 
the prediction is incorrect.
