Discussion
****************************************
Given the results from the sentiment analysis we performed in weka, we 
reached the conclusion that the features we used were not representative enough 
(or not sufficient) to effectively generalize the predictions. We therefore 
attempted to make the predictions more robust by adding four more features: 
positive words, negative words, positive emoticons and negative emoticons.
The positive and negative words are a subset of words extracted from the nrc 
emotion lexicon database, while the emoticons are a subjective compilation 
made by ourselves.

We can observe a significant increase in testing accuracy with the addition of 
these features, taking our classifier from 53% to 58% accuracy. While this 
is still far from a state-of-the-art classifier, the increase can only be 
attributed to the added features. Another thing to note is that we ran tests 
without the emoticons as features and the results were identical, which 
suggests (much to our surprise) that the presence of emoticons in a tweet is 
not a good indicator of sentiment (either that, or there were simply not enough 
examples with emoticons in the training set for the system to consider them a 
useful feature).
