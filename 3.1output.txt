Discussion:
****************************************
The result of our tests give us Naive Bayes as the best classifier by a small 
margin. SVM give us a slightly better training accuracy (62.47%) but a 
slightly worse generalization (with a 50.60% accuracy on the test set).
Decision trees on the other hand, give a significantly higher training accuracy
(78.38%) but also a significantly worse generalization (48.56% accuracy on 
the test set), which suggests overfitting to the training data.
